No protection whatsoever, except for ASLR enabled. The program gives the pointer to the char[64] buffer it created, meaning we won't need to find an offset to get a jumpable adress, nor do a NOPsled.

We just need to write our shellcode to the start of the buffer, pad it with junk until we reach RIP then overwrite it with the address we're printed.

Finding the offset was quite easy with gdb-peda and pattern : 72

Crafting our payload with pwntools and trying it... SIGSEGV still. Dafuk ?

Turns out pwntools' shellcraft gave me a bad shellcode.

I used [this one](https://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-806.php) instead, which worked perfectly

We launch our `solve.py` and we are greeted with a shell, a ls and a cat flag.txt later weget our flag

`404CTF{V0U5_3735_Pr37_P0Ur_14_Pr0CH41N3_M15510N}`
